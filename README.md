# AndroidGpsHelpers
Packages some GPS related Android-specific Java code from around the web into some ready to use classes.

Because your app can get bombarded with locations, this package includes some built-in and 
configurable code to get that under control.

In the future I'll be adding an SQL database that can be used to store and retrieve locations.
